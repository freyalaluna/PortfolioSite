#### Welcome to my blog!

My name is Freya LaLuna, nice to meet you! I'm a junior developer with an interest in all things backend, database, and networking.

I'm currently waiting in the wings to be hired on to a yet-to-be-announced project as a junior full-stack developer. With our current start date estimate having been shifted back to sometime in early April of next year, it's really started to weigh on me that that's a long time to be waiting and doing nothing. However, if I reframe that thought, I've realized that this is maybe the densest period of free time I'll have in the next few years of my life. Doing nothing, or otherwise riding out this wait would absolutely squander the four whole months I'll have to work on the personal projects and self-guided learning that I likely won't have the time to do once I'm fully employed.

Given all of that, I thought it would be a great idea to share my progress throughout the ensuing months! I hope you enjoy reading about my exploration and growth!
