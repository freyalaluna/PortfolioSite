      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;welcome-to-my-blog&#34;&gt;Welcome to my blog!&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My name is Freya LaLuna, nice to meet you! I&amp;rsquo;m a junior developer with an interest in all things backend, database, and networking.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m currently waiting in the wings to be hired on to a yet-to-be-announced project as a junior full-stack developer. With our current start date estimate having been shifted back to sometime in early April of next year, it&amp;rsquo;s really started to weigh on me that that&amp;rsquo;s a long time to be waiting and doing nothing. However, if I reframe that thought, I&amp;rsquo;ve realized that this is maybe the densest period of free time I&amp;rsquo;ll have in the next few years of my life. Doing nothing, or otherwise riding out this wait would absolutely squander the four whole months I&amp;rsquo;ll have to work on the personal projects and self-guided learning that I likely won&amp;rsquo;t have the time to do once I&amp;rsquo;m fully employed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
